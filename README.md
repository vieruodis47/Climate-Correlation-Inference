# Team & Contributions
Project Lead: Michelle Lyu <br>
Responsibilities: Project architecture, statistical modeling (Linear Regression), data cleaning (NASA/NOAA integration), and final report synthesis in R-Markdown. <br>
Collaborators: Michelle, Maria, Nusaybah, Jigme. <br>

# Key Findings
Strong Correlation: The analysis revealed a very strong positive linear relationship between atmospheric CO2 and global temperature anomalies, with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.94.<br>
Statistical Significance: Using a significance level of alpha = 0.05, the study yielded a p-value of approximately 0, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the relationship is statistically significant.<br>
Predictive Power: For every 1 ppm increase in CO2 concentration, global temperature anomalies are estimated to increase by approximately 0.0104°C (based on the slope).<br>
Confidence Interval: We are 95% confident that the true slope of the relationship lies between 0.00923 and 0.0115, indicating a highly precise estimate.<br>
