# Team & Contributions
**Project Lead**: Michelle Lyu <br>
**Responsibilities**: Project architecture, statistical modeling (Linear Regression), data cleaning (NASA/NOAA integration), and final report synthesis in R-Markdown. <br>
**Collaborators**: Michelle, Maria, Nusaybah, Jigme. <br>

# Key Findings
**Strong Correlation**: The analysis revealed a very strong positive linear relationship between atmospheric CO2 and global temperature anomalies, with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.94.<br>
**Statistical Significance**: Using a significance level of alpha = 0.05, the study yielded a p-value of approximately 0, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the relationship is statistically significant.<br>
**Predictive Power**: For every 1 ppm increase in CO2 concentration, global temperature anomalies are estimated to increase by approximately 0.0104°C (based on the slope).<br>
**Confidence Interval**: We are 95% confident that the true slope of the relationship lies between 0.00923 and 0.0115, indicating a highly precise estimate.<br>

# Validation Note
To ensure model robustness, I performed a residual analysis. While a subtle curved pattern was observed in the residuals—suggesting potential for non-linear modeling in future research, the linear model was determined to be a highly effective and reasonable fit for the 1980–2023 timeframe.
